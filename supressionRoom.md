# Trash after Vael / Supression Room

Once vael is dead, the next target is the infamous Supression Room. Before the raid can
enter the gauntlet, there is some trash they must go through.

## Vael Trash

The trash is skippable by having the entire raid hide behind a corner while a hunter pulls the group
and feigns once everyone's through.

If your raid is up for it, the mobs can be killed and have a chance to drop epics. The Death Talon Captain
should be kited by a hunter around Vael's room by running up and down the stairs while the rest of the raid get
the mobs. Make sure that someone in the raid buffs the hunter while they're running around. If not, there is
a possibility that the mobs will respawn when the hunter resets. [This video](https://youtu.be/ViurYyGYBCs?t=140)
provides a good overview of how to kite this pack.

The mobs should be tanked (1 tank to each) on the corner before the path on to the supression room.
Wyrmkinds need to be kept asleep by druids.
