# Alchemy Lab

## Trash

The trash in the alchemy lab (known as the "lab packs") consist of a mix of
Warlocks, Spellbinders, Goblins, and Death Talon Overseers. A tank needs to be
assigned to each of these and they have a kill order of Warlocks > Spellbinders/Overseer > Goblins.

The warlocks do a large amount of AoE damage and should be burned down as quickly as possible.
Their shadow bolt volleys should be kicked and the group should be careful to stay away from the
tanks to avoid flamestrikes.

Once they are down, the raid should split up and melee should attack the Spellbinders
(who are invulneral to magic) while ranged dps attacks the Overseers. The Overseers have
very high resistance for 4 of the 5 damage types, and are very weak to one. Once the
group pulls one of these mobs, everyone should try a different damage type and call out
the type when they see big numbers. If a ranged dps cannot do damage of the appropriate
type, they should focus on another mob if possible.

When attacking spellbinders, the dps should attack on the opposite side of the spellbinder
as the tank in order to avoid AoE damage.

## The Dragons

The next three pulls are all drake bosses. They each share 3 the same three spells and have one 
extra one:

**Shadow Flame**: Deals 4000-5000 damage in a frontal cone. Handling this is very similar to a 
Onyxia's flame breath. Healers should make sure that the tank is topped off/shielded before this is 
cast.

**Wing Buffet**: Wing buffet knocks the target back and drops their threat by 50%. The off-tank should
taunt the drake 3-4 seconds before this is cast so that the main tank can maintain threat.

**Thrash**: Gives the attacker two extra attacks. Their melee do around 1k dmg so this will do 3000-4000 
damage randomly. This is why the tank must always be topped off and the dps can be largely ignored. 

### Firemaw

Positioning is everything in this fight. If the boss moves even a little, the raid will wipe. Luckily, 
melee don't have to take damage if they don't want to. There is a spot in the map where they can stand
and avoid any damage, allowing them to bandage. Healers should focus primarily on keeping the tank up
