# Alchemy Lab

## Trash

The trash in the alchemy lab (known as the "lab packs") consist of a mix of
Warlocks, Spellbinders, Goblins, and Death Talon Overseers. A tank needs to be
assigned to each of these and they have a kill order of Warlocks > Spellbinders/Overseer > Goblins.

The warlocks do a large amount of AoE damage and should be burned down as quickly as possible.
Their shadow bolt volleys should be kicked and the group should be careful to stay away from the
tanks to avoid flamestrikes.

Once they are down, the raid should split up and melee should attack the Spellbinders
(who are invulneral to magic) while ranged dps attacks the Overseers. The Overseers have
very high resistance for 4 of the 5 damage types, and are very weak to one. Once the
group pulls one of these mobs, everyone should try a different damage type and call out
the type when they see big numbers. If a ranged dps cannot do damage of the appropriate
type, they should focus on another mob if possible.

When attacking spellbinders, the dps should attack on the opposite side of the spellbinder
as the tank in order to avoid AoE damage.
