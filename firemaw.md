# Lab Packs

T

After broodlord, the next pull consist of two warlocks, and a pack of goblins. The locks do
a large amount of AoE damage and need to be killed as quickly as possible.
Their AoE shadow bolt should be kicked to prevent lots of raid-wide damage.
If demons are summoned, they should be kept banished by locks. The goblins always focus on
the same target and chuck dynamite (with a cast time). If you run in a large enough circle
(about the size of a frost trap) they won't hit the person with aggro.

The trash also has the large Death Talon Overseer. These mobs have very high resistance for 4 of the 5
damage types, and are very weak to one. Once the group pulls one of these mobs, everyone should
try a different damage type and call out the type when they see big numbers. If a ranged dps
cannot do damage of the appropriate type, they should focus on another mob if possible.

The other mob in the packs is the Spellbinders. They are totally immune to magic so the melee dps should
focus on them while the range dps gets the drakonids. The spellbinder should be tanked between its
designated tank and the dps group
