# Vaelastrasz the Corrupt

## General Idea

Vael starts friendly at 30% health and must be burned down before the entire raid dies from an
unavoidable dot that explodes when it expires. This boss is simply a DPS race and requires around
the same damage as killing rag before he submerges.

## Group Makeup

This encounter's only requirements is two tanks that can generate enough threat to hold the boss.

## Positioning

The first tank should stand in front of the boss. Melee dps stand behind his right leg and ranged should
behind them. Vael's cleave chains off of people so everyone needs to stack very tight. Luckily,
there is no need for melee to move in this fight so once we have set it up, they can just focus on damage.

Before the fight, establish a place that ranged dps will run if they get the bomb.

## The Encounter

On screen, this fight is relatively straight forward. At the beginning, everyone receives
[Essence of the Red](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=23513/essence-of-the-red) to help them burn
the boss down. Periodically, a manage user will get
[Burning Adrenanline](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=18173/burning-adrenaline) that will kill them
in 20 seconds and cause an explosion/knock back. This death is avoidable so ranged so go to the designated
spot and go out with a bang. Occasionally the player with the highest threat will also get the DoT and die.
When this happens (really when the tank notices they got the DoT) the person that's second in threat needs
to get where the tank is.

## Notes:

- Warriors need to watch their threat in the first 10% because once they start spamming execute they will
  generate a LOT of threat. It's better that they chill out at the beginning than have to stop spamming
  execute because they are going to pass the tank.
- The melee second in threat should be ready to move where the boss is if the tank is going down
- Healers should be using max raid heals
- DoT gives instant casts so ranged should be doing damage while running into position
- Improved backstab is super important for rogues
- A paladin with improved lay on hands needs to keep it on the tank at all times
- Tank should pop recklessness at 3 seconds, and death wish at 1.5s to help establish a lead at the beginning
